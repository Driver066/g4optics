# Steel Module Production Phase-2B Recovery Amendment

Status: incident/accounting and portable-lock foundations implemented and
locally regression-tested; predecessor attempt not yet sealed; successor
execution, compute preflight, readiness lock, production intent, and retry
submission remain absent

Incident date: 2026-07-18

## Decision

The first managed `BC-S1` attempt is classified as a **pre-simulation
control-plane failure**.  It is not a Geant4 result and contributes zero events
to the production estimate.

The historical Phase-2B execution companion is closed to further production
attempts.  Recovery will use an additive, versioned successor execution; the
old implementation commit, readiness commit, execution manifest, intent,
event chain, Slurm job, logs, and terminal accounting remain immutable
predecessor evidence.

No seed is replaced.  The successor will reuse the exact Phase-2A mapping of
32 logical tasks, 8,000 events, and 64 production seeds only after the sealed
incident proves that the historical worker never invoked Geant4.

## Historical identities

Slurm job         50532143
```

The account-case recovery that adopted and released job `50532143` remains
part of the immutable event chain.  It is not removed or rewritten by this
amendment.

## Observed OSC evidence

The login-node `.control.lock` still exactly matches the historical manifest:

```text
device=214 inode=958967 mode=600 size=0 links=1
sha256=e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855
```

A later login session showed that even two OSC login nodes can report a
different numeric device/inode identity for this same shared path.  The first
recovery sealer therefore failed before scheduler access for the same reason
as the workers.  Historical sealing now has one narrowly scoped lock path:
it accepts only the exact execution, attempt, intent, job, readiness-bound
manifest/checksum identities, and original empty `0600` lock record above;
it ignores only the current node's numeric device/inode.  It still requires a
regular one-link file, `O_NOFOLLOW`, content/mode/size checks, `flock`, and
same-node path/descriptor identity checks before, during, and after the
critical section.  Ordinary v1 loaders and every production worker or
submission mutation retain the original strict behavior.

All 32 array logs contain exactly:

```text
Cannot run managed steel-module production task: managed execution
control-lock inode identity mismatch
```

The attempt has no `tasks/` directory, ROOT file, task-result marker, run
configuration, or summary.  The worker calls `load_execution_companion()`
before creating the task directory and before invoking Apptainer or Geant4.
The accepted incident disposition is therefore:

```text
Geant4 invocations          0
committed simulation events 0
production seeds consumed   0
```

OSC accounting exposes array identity as follows:

```text
logical JobID    JobIDRaw
50532143_1       50533282
...
50532143_31      50533312
50532143_32      50532143
```

There is no separate logical parent row.  The final task may reuse the parent
number as its numeric `JobIDRaw`; this does not make it a parent row.  A
terminal job may also disappear from `squeue`, causing `squeue -j 50532143` to
report `Invalid job id specified`.  Recovery therefore:

- derives array indexes only from logical `JobID`;
- preserves `JobIDRaw` as scheduler provenance;
- requires the exact logical set `1..32`;
- does not require a separate parent row;
- checks live activity by the unique job-name token rather than terminal job
  lookup by ID.

OSC also canonicalizes the submitted account `PAS2524` to `pas2524` in
`scontrol`.  Successor verification accepts only that exact ASCII-lowercase
representation (or the exact original spelling), records expected and observed
values in the immutable `job-verified` event, and rejects every other account.

## Root cause and lock protocol amendment

The v1 materializer recorded login-node `st_dev` and `st_ino` as persistent
lock authority, and every compute worker required those numeric values to be
identical.  OSC's shared filesystem does not promise that cross-node view.
The readiness suite exercised local subprocesses on the login node, so it did
not test this assumption on a compute node.

The successor uses portable lock protocol v2:

- manifest authority is the fixed path, regular-file type, mode, size,
  one-link requirement, and a random content token plus SHA-256;
- creation-time device/inode values are diagnostic only;
- each process performs `lstat`, `open(O_NOFOLLOW)`, `fstat`, and same-node
  path/file identity checks before and after `flock`;
- mode, link count, size, and token/hash are checked before, while holding,
  and after the critical section;
- symlink, hard-link, content, mode, and size changes are rejected; pathname
  replacement is detected at lock acquisition and again on critical-section
  exit.

The v2 protocol does not claim that an actor with arbitrary write access to
the whole execution root can never replace a same-content lock immediately
before acquisition, nor can an exit-time detection roll back an irreversible
action already performed inside the section. Therefore successor readiness
must additionally prove that compute workers cannot replace the static
execution root or `.control.lock`, and any scheduler call must occur only
after all lock and authority validation. Until those permissions and the
compute-node preflight pass, portable lock v2 is a local foundation rather
than accepted OSC execution authority.

The amendment removes only the false cross-node invariant.  It does not weaken
the content-addressed execution, intent, source, runtime, or event-chain
bindings.

## Staged recovery

### R1: seal the predecessor incident

The incident sealer has two explicit modes:

1. `--check-only` reads and validates the historical execution, intent, event
   chain, 32 logs, terminal `sacct`, and empty live `squeue` result.  It writes
   nothing.
2. `--seal` atomically freezes terminal accounting, appends the existing
   `terminal-accounting-frozen` event, and publishes one content-addressed
   incident bundle under:

   ```text
   $WORK/campaigns/steel-module-production-incidents/
     bc-s1-50532143-<incident-hash12>/
   ```

The bundle contains `incident.json`, the complete event chain, logical/raw
accounting, the 32-log index, and independent checksums.  It never calls
`sbatch` or `scontrol`.

Before either allowed `sacct`/`squeue` read, the formal sealer verifies the
readiness-bound canonical companion and byte hashes, the single historical
intent/attempt lineage, the exact six-step hash-valid release path (including
the account-case scheduler observation), all 32 exact failure logs, and the
absence of task, ROOT, or result output.  Its scheduler gateway accepts
only the two fixed read-only command lines recorded by readiness.  Accounting
publication and the terminal event share one exclusive historical recovery
lock; a crash after publication can only validate the v2 logical/raw Job-ID
snapshot and append the missing event, without another scheduler read.

### R2: materialize a successor execution

Only after the incident hash is frozen may a new sibling be created:

```text
$WORK/campaigns/steel-module-production-bc-s1-execution-v2
```

It must bind the predecessor execution, R lock, intent, job, event,
accounting, and incident hashes.  It must also prove that its task rows, scan
arguments, seed mapping, simulation source, executable, container image, and
Geant4 data identity exactly equal Phase-2A.

The first successor intent mode is `predecessor-retry`, not `initial`.  It may
select all 32 tasks only from the incident's zero-consumption disposition.

### R3: compute-node loader preflight

Before successor readiness can be accepted, one separately authorized,
loader-only Slurm job must exercise the frozen successor control source and
portable lock on an OSC compute node.  It must not invoke Apptainer or Geant4
and must leave the production `intents/`, `attempts/`, and task-output roots
empty.

The preflight job ID, login/compute lock diagnostics, result, terminal
accounting, and checksums become readiness evidence.  A login-node subprocess
is not a substitute.

### R4: additive recovery readiness

A new tracked readiness lock binds implementation, incident, successor, and
compute-preflight evidence.  It distinguishes historical scheduler contact
from successor state:

```text
predecessor production jobs       [50532143]
compute preflight jobs             [<preflight job>]
successor production intent count  0
successor production jobs          []
automatic submission               false
```

The old R file is never edited.  The successor remains unsubmittable until the
new additive lock is reviewed, committed, pushed, pulled, and revalidated.

## Prohibited shortcuts

- Do not modify or replace the old `.control.lock`, manifest, source archive,
  readiness lock, intent, event files, or logs.
- Do not create `retry-failed` under the old execution; its frozen worker still
  contains the v1 bug. The current manager also rejects new prepare/submit
  operations for the exact historical execution ID and hash.
- Do not label the failed scheduler tasks as successful or cancelled.
- Do not generate replacement seeds.
- Do not create a production checkpoint or progression decision from the
  predecessor incident.
- Do not submit the successor before its compute preflight and additive
  readiness lock are complete.

## Current stopping point

This amendment currently authorizes implementation and local testing of the
incident/accounting and portable-lock foundations only.  It does not itself
seal the OSC incident, create the successor, contact Slurm, authorize seed
reuse, or permit a production retry.
