# Steel Module Production Phase-2C: Production-ready execution-v6

Status: D6 decision checkpoint accepted; implementation, OSC preflight, clean
execution-v6 materialization, and R6 readiness remain pending.

Decision checkpoint date: 2026-07-19

This is an additive successor to the completed R3 GPFS recovery recorded in
`steel-module-production-r3-gpfs-flock-recovery-v1.md`. It defines how the
accepted execution-v5 preflight evidence may lead to a clean, future-submittable
BC-S1 execution-v6. It does not itself create scheduler or production
authority.

## 1. Objective and fixed boundary

Phase-2C converts the accepted execution-v5 R3 evidence into an independently
validated execution-v6 while keeping the future production workspace pristine:

```text
accepted v5 evidence
        -> production-critical C6 snapshot
        -> sacrificial preflight twin
        -> held no-Geant4 R3 -> twin closed
        -> byte-equivalence proof
        -> clean execution-v6
        -> lock-only R6 readiness
        -> STOP
```

The authorized BC-S1 study remains exactly:

```text
layout                    back-center
tile thicknesses          4 mm and 24 mm
blocks per configuration  16
events per block          250
logical tasks             32
requested events          8,000
production seeds          the original 64-seed Phase-2A mapping
first production mode     predecessor-retry
```

Simulation source, physics, executable, runtime image, Geant4 data, and
environment identities remain unchanged. Execution-v5 and every earlier
execution are permanently closed, read-only historical evidence.

Phase-2C may use one separately and explicitly authorized held, non-array,
no-Geant4 compute preflight. Phase-2C does not create a production intent,
submit BC-S1 production, invoke Geant4, produce production results, or unlock
`FIXED`, `BC-S2`, `BC-S3`, or `BC-S4`. It ends at an R6 readiness lock with
zero production intents and zero production Slurm jobs.

## 2. Accepted predecessor evidence

The completed recovery supplies the immutable predecessor:

```text
execution_id   sm-v1-production-bc-s1-execution-v5-704c313624aa
execution_hash dd774195e93a5c5e479815fd265c2de629fa71f22a30cae0a13284e0e828b73e
R3 job         50561809
evidence_id    sm-v1-r3-container-probe-732cc54bbeb7
evidence_hash  732cc54bbeb7f42a2c537d7c343db6ca090b169b6ec700c21ec2d4b98af73c24
```

The checksum-valid evidence records Apptainer invoked, Geant4 not invoked,
execution-v5 closed, and zero production intents and attempts. The complete
evidence hash, rather than only its shortened ID suffix, is an input identity
for every Phase-2C object.

## 3. Identity model and canonical objects

Phase-2C introduces four versioned schemas:

- `steel-module-production-phase2c-preflight-twin-v1`;
- `steel-module-production-managed-execution-v6`;
- `steel-module-production-phase2c-preflight-evidence-v1`;
- `steel-module-production-phase2c-readiness-lock-v1`.

The canonical OSC locations are:

```text
$WORK/campaigns/steel-module-production-bc-s1-preflight-v6
$WORK/campaigns/steel-module-production-bc-s1-execution-v6
$WORK/evidence/steel-module-production-phase2c/
hpc/osc/configurations/steel-module-production-phase2c-v1.lock.json
```

Content-addressed identities use these forms:

```text
sm-v1-production-bc-s1-preflight-v6-<hash12>
sm-v1-production-bc-s1-execution-v6-<hash12>
sm-v1-phase2c-preflight-<hash12>
```

The preflight twin and execution-v6 share one
`production_equivalence_hash`. It covers all production-relevant bytes and
semantics:

- `tasks.tsv`, `scan_args.txt`, and the complete task/seed mapping;
- recursive checksum manifests for simulation and control sources;
- runtime image, Geant4 data, executable, and environment identities;
- critical blob hashes for the production worker, batch launcher, task-result
  recorder, container builder, loaders, and readiness verifier;
- the portable-lock protocol, `0600` mode, empty-content hash, size, and
  one-link policy;
- account, array shape, resources, held submission, no-requeue, and clean
  export policy.

Instance-specific data is deliberately excluded from the equivalence hash:
execution ID and path, twin/v6 role, numeric control-lock device/inode values,
the R3 job and journal, and mutable-root records. Device and inode remain
diagnostic only; lock protocol, type, mode, content, size, and link count remain
strict authority.

## 4. Materialization and immutable publication

The formal interfaces are:

```text
materialize-preflight-v6 --check-only | --materialize
validate-preflight-v6

materialize-execution-v6 --check-only | --materialize
validate-execution-v6
```

Formal mode exposes no path, source, account, task, or scheduler override. The
twin binds the accepted execution-v5 evidence but can never acquire production
authority. Execution-v6 may be materialized only after a successful,
checksum-valid Phase-2C preflight evidence bundle closes that twin.

After the successful preflight, the execution-v6 materializer copies frozen
sources exclusively from the checksum-valid twin static tree. It must not
re-archive a later checkout. This makes the production equivalence proof a
byte-level relationship rather than an assertion about two separately made
archives.

The twin and execution-v6 each receive a newly created `0600` portable lock;
no historical inode is copied. Publication uses a sibling temporary directory,
flushes file and directory data, and performs a no-replace atomic rename.
Existing targets, symlinks, path escape, concurrent publication, and partial
output all fail closed.

Execution-v6 begins with exactly empty `intents/`, `attempts/`, and
`finalized/` roots. Its validator re-proves the complete chain:

```text
Phase-2A
  -> original pre-simulation incident
  -> execution-v2/v3/v4 histories
  -> successful execution-v5 R3 evidence
  -> Phase-2C preflight twin
  -> successful Phase-2C R3 evidence
  -> production equivalence hash
  -> clean execution-v6
```

## 5. Isolated Phase-2C preflight control plane

The preflight manager is separate from the production manager and supports:

```text
status
prepare --check-only | --write-authorization
submit --check-only | --submit
verify-held
release --check-only | --release
reconcile
freeze-accounting
```

Its immutable journal lives under the external Phase-2C evidence root. It does
not prewrite an intent or attempt into either the sacrificial twin or the clean
execution-v6.

The scheduler contract is fixed:

```text
shape          one non-array task
submission     --hold --parsable --no-requeue --export=NONE
account        PAS2524 (scheduler reads may return ASCII lowercase pas2524)
resources      1 CPU, 1 GiB, 10 minutes
job name       g4sm-p2c-<twin-hash12>
payload        frozen no-Geant4 launcher
```

There is no command, source, path, account, or resource override. Held identity
must be verified before a separately authorized release. A successful evidence
bundle must prove:

```text
apptainer_invoked           true
geant4_invoked              false
events_consumed             0
production_seeds_consumed   0
twin_execution_closed       true
production_equivalence_hash exact
```

An ambiguous or failed submission never triggers another automatic `sbatch`.
Only the already submitted job may be reconciled. After failure evidence is
sealed, that twin is permanently closed and execution-v6 cannot be
materialized. A retry requires a new content-addressed twin and a new explicit
preflight authorization, but it does not create an execution-v7 production
chain.

## 6. Execution-v6 production admission

The unified production manager and frozen worker may formally target only the
canonical execution-v6. Before R6, the manager, worker, recorder, finalizer,
and downstream tools must reject the execution before creating a task
directory, invoking Apptainer, or invoking Geant4.

After valid R6 readiness, the first possible production intent is fixed to
`predecessor-retry`. It must select all 32 tasks, all 8,000 events, and the
original 64 seeds. `initial`, one-task smoke, any task subset, and altered seed
mapping are rejected. Future `resume` or `retry-failed` becomes eligible only
after a checksum-valid terminal production attempt exists.

The Phase-2C implementation must route the complete future evidence path for
execution-v6 without exercising it in this phase:

- task-result recording and terminal-accounting freeze;
- whole-child finalization with integrated event and seed audit;
- exact `BC-ONLY-S1` checkpoint construction;
- production checkpoint analysis;
- offline review rendering;
- append-only progression recording.

These are implementation and synthetic-test obligations, not authorization to
create real production evidence during Phase-2C.

## 7. C6 and R6 release model

Phase-2C has three version-control checkpoints:

1. **D6 decision checkpoint.** This English record and the completed GPFS
   recovery checkpoint are committed separately before implementation. A local
   ignored Chinese mirror is maintained for operator readability.
2. **C6 implementation commit.** Code, documentation, adversarial fixtures,
   fake-scheduler tests, and synthetic execution-v6 downstream validation are
   frozen. No tracked R6 readiness lock exists yet.
3. **R6 readiness-lock commit.** After OSC accepts C6, the one authorized
   preflight succeeds, evidence is sealed, and a clean equivalent execution-v6
   is materialized, the reviewed non-authoritative proposal supplies the sole
   tracked delta in R6.

R6 must be the direct non-merge child of final C6. Its only tracked difference
from C6 is:

```text
hpc/osc/configurations/steel-module-production-phase2c-v1.lock.json
```

The lock binds C6 commit/tree and critical blobs, the complete execution-v5
evidence identity, twin identity, accepted preflight job/accounting/evidence,
the production equivalence hash, the clean execution-v6 identity and empty
mutable snapshot, task/event/seed and source/runtime identities, and OSC
checker evidence. The required terminal state is:

```text
managed_submission_ready    true
automatic_submission        false
production_intent_count     0
production_slurm_job_ids    []
preflight_slurm_job_ids     [<accepted job>]
real_production_submission  false
```

The R6 formal validator proves the lock-only direct-child relationship, clean
checkout, protected byte identities, preflight evidence, equivalence, and zero
production contact.

## 8. Required verification

Automated fixtures and OSC acceptance must cover, at minimum:

- tamper of execution-v5 evidence, twin, equivalence data, execution-v6, or
  R6 identity/checksum/path;
- symlink/path escape, partial publication, existing target, and concurrent
  publish rejection;
- mismatch of any production-critical blob between twin and execution-v6;
- diagnostic-only device/inode handling while enforcing lock protocol, mode,
  content, size, and link count;
- fake-scheduler success, timeout, invalid response, zero/one/multiple-job
  reconciliation, release ambiguity, and account-case comparison;
- forbidden-command sentinels proving fixtures never call real `sbatch` or
  `scontrol`;
- twin closure without creating or mutating execution-v6;
- refusal to materialize execution-v6 after failed preflight;
- exact empty mutable roots after successful execution-v6 materialization;
- pre-readiness rejection before task directory, Apptainer, or Geant4;
- exact first-intent selection of 32 tasks, 8,000 events, and 64 seeds under a
  valid R6 fixture, while rejecting smoke tasks and subsets;
- synthetic execution-v6 finalizer/checkpoint/analyzer end to end;
- regression coverage for v1-v5, the historical incident, pilot, production
  program, and v1/v2 analyzers.

OSC acceptance requires a clean C6 checkout; passing top-level and focused
checkers; twin materialization and validation; separately authorized held-job
identity and release; terminal accounting and evidence validation;
execution-v6 equivalence and empty-root validation; and final verification of
the lock-only R6 child.

## 9. Rollout and mandatory stop

The fixed operational order is:

1. commit and push D6;
2. implement, test, commit, and push C6;
3. pull clean C6 on OSC and run all checkers;
4. check then materialize the preflight twin without scheduler contact;
5. obtain separate human authorization and write the preflight authorization;
6. inspect the submit check, then explicitly submit the held preflight;
7. verify held identity and obtain separate human authorization to release;
8. freeze accounting, seal evidence, and audit semantics and checksums;
9. materialize and validate the clean execution-v6 from the accepted twin;
10. produce and review the non-authoritative R6 proposal;
11. create, push, pull, and formally validate the lock-only R6 commit;
12. stop.

Phase-2C stops before any production intent, BC-S1 production `sbatch`, Geant4
invocation, production finalization or analysis, or later-child unlock. Only a
subsequent phase may proceed through read-only status, exact
`predecessor-retry` intent check, explicit intent write and hash review,
submission check, separate confirmation, and a held 32-task BC-S1 production
array.
