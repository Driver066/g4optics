# Steel-module R3 writer-probe recovery v1

Status: root cause fixed in control-plane commit `debfc2d6`; rejected-probe
sealing, execution-v4, and downstream lineage support are implementation
complete. Formal OSC rejection sealing, v4 materialization, and the one-job R3
preflight remain pending. No production intent or Geant4 production task is
authorized by this document.

This is an additive amendment to
`steel-module-production-r3-bootstrap-recovery-v1.md`. It does not modify any
physics input, Phase-2A task, event count, or production seed.

## 1. Observed execution-v3 preflight

The first correctly admitted execution-v3 R3 probe used:

- execution ID `sm-v1-production-bc-s1-execution-v3-e3bd626fe694`;
- execution hash
  `30d01a2a03d97f3cc5bb54cf1364d5259ccabc0fbfe2aeefa04d59e441b9781a`;
- Slurm job `50548308`;
- job name `g4sm-r3-30d01a2a03d9`.

The held scheduler identity was reviewed before release. The job ran
Apptainer on an OSC compute node without invoking Geant4. The parent and batch
step terminated `FAILED / 1:0`; the extern step completed. The raw probe
recorded `probe_passed=false` with exactly these two false report keys:

```text
static_writer_open_rejected
control_lock_writer_open_rejected
```

All mount-topology, create-rejection, original-path, adjacent-path, challenge,
round-trip, runtime, portable-lock, and execution-snapshot checks passed. The
execution snapshot was byte-identical before and after the probe. Therefore
the failure is classified as a probe-instrumentation failure, not evidence
that either frozen file was modified or that the execution root was writable.

The externally frozen inputs are:

```text
held scontrol  4cd17d0100d51b11b17b556d3173206702065f6e0ea241b130fd3052100a3f55

```

## 2. Root cause

The container helper used this condition:

```bash
if (exec 9>>"${target}"; exec 9>&-) 2>/dev/null; then
```

Commands used as an `if` test are exempt from Bash `errexit`. When the writer
open was correctly denied, Bash continued to the descriptor-close command.
The close succeeded and replaced the failed open status with zero, so the
helper falsely reported the file as openable.

The fixed helper tests only the writer open inside one subshell:

```bash
if (exec 9>>"${target}") 2>/dev/null; then
```

The regression suite exercises an absent-parent target, a mode-0400 file, a
writable file, inherited descriptor 9, and copied-launcher nonzero exit-code
propagation. The focused R3 checker passes with the fix.

## 3. Immutable-history rule

Execution-v3 and job `50548308` remain immutable rejected-preflight history.
In particular, do not:

- delete, move, rename, or overwrite its raw workspace;
- edit its frozen control source, manifest, lock, launcher, or log;
- feed its failed raw result into the accepted-preflight sealer;
- omit it from later compute-preflight history;
- create a production intent under execution-v3.

A content-addressed rejection bundle must bind the raw workspace, held
identity, terminal accounting, empty terminal queue, Slurm log, current
execution snapshot, exact false-key set, and zero event/seed consumption.

## 4. Why execution-v4 is required

The bug is frozen inside execution-v3. An external repair wrapper could run a
green diagnostic, but execution-v3's frozen worker and R4 validator would
reject its command identity, updated code, and expanded preflight history.
Making that external path authoritative would create a split control plane.

The recovery therefore uses a new canonical sibling:

```text
$WORK/campaigns/steel-module-production-bc-s1-execution-v4
```

Execution-v4 must bind execution-v3 and the sealed `50548308` rejection. It
must preserve, byte-for-byte or by exact identity:

- all 32 logical tasks and scan arguments;
- 8,000 requested events and all 64 production seeds;
- the simulation source;
- the executable, Apptainer image, Geant4 data manifest, and environment;
- the sealed-pilot, production-program, original production incident, and
  earlier R3 failure lineage.

The earlier job `50544247` and rejected probe `50548308` are compute-preflight
history. Job `50547698` is retained separately as a pre-probe administrative
launcher rejection; it must not enter compute-preflight, physics-result, or
terminal-accounting lists.

Only the control-plane source and execution-generation metadata may change.
Execution-v4 begins with empty `intents/`, `attempts/`, and `finalized/`.

## 5. Next accepted-preflight boundary

After the rejection bundle and execution-v4 pass local and OSC validation, one
separately reviewed, held, non-array R3 job may be submitted. It remains a
no-Geant4 container-isolation preflight. A successful bundle must record:

```text
failed compute preflights   [50544247, 50548308]
accepted compute preflight  [<new execution-v4 job>]
all compute preflights      [50544247, 50548308, <new execution-v4 job>]
production intents/jobs     0 / []
```

Only after that success may a separate lock-only R4 decision be considered.
This document does not authorize R4 or the BC-S1 production submission.
